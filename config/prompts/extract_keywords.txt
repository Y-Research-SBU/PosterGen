Analyze poster content and identify keywords for strategic visual highlighting using three distinct formatting styles.

**Input Data:**
- Enhanced Narrative: {{ enhanced_narrative }}
- Curated Content: {{ curated_content }}

**Core Task:**
For each section, identify keywords and assign them to specific highlighting styles based on their semantic importance and role in the research narrative.

**Highlighting Style Categories:**

**1. BOLD + CONTRAST COLOR (will be rendered as `**<color:{contrast_color}>text</color>**`)**
- **Purpose**: Core method/methodology names that represent the paper's unique contribution
- **Criteria**: 
  * Novel algorithms, architectures, or techniques introduced by this work
  * The main methodological innovation that defines the paper
  * Must be unique to this research (not generic terms)
- **Limit**: Maximum 2 per section, prefer 1 if it captures the main contribution

**2. BOLD (will be rendered as `**text**`)**
- **Purpose**: Important quantitative results and core technical terms within each section
- **Criteria**:
  * Performance metrics and numerical results (e.g., "95% accuracy", "5.2x speedup")
  * Key technical concepts central to understanding the section
  * Architecture names, dataset names, established method names
  * Word-level emphasis, not entire phrases
- **Limit**: Maximum 3 per section

**3. ITALIC (will be rendered as `*text*`)**
- **Purpose**: Defining terms, single-word emphasis, and foreign terminology  
- **Criteria**:
  * Technical terms being defined or introduced for the first time
  * Single-word emphasis (e.g., "This was the only experiment")
  * Foreign words, Latin terms, or specialized vocabulary
  * Word-level application only, never entire sentences
- **Limit**: Maximum 2 per section

**Critical Rules:**
1. **Word-Level Only**: Never apply formatting to entire sentences or long phrases
2. **Mutual Exclusivity**: Each keyword gets exactly one formatting style
3. **Semantic Appropriateness**: Style choice based on semantic role, not arbitrary assignment
4. **Conservative Application**: Better to under-highlight than over-highlight

**Output Format Requirements:**
- **Output ONLY pure text keywords**: No formatting markup in the JSON output
- Keywords must match EXACTLY as they appear in the content text (without any ** or * or <color> tags)
- Case-sensitive matching: use exact capitalization from source text
- Include technical terminology and proper nouns as written

**Output Schema:**
```json
{
  "section_keywords": {
    "motivation": {
      "bold_contrast": ["DP-CutMixSL"],
      "bold": ["Vision Transformers", "privacy leakage"],
      "italic": ["federated"]
    },
    "method": {
      "bold_contrast": ["CutMix", "differential privacy"],
      "bold": ["95% accuracy", "ResNet-50"],
      "italic": ["only"]
    },
    "results": {
      "bold_contrast": ["TransformerNet"],
      "bold": ["top-1 accuracy", "5.2x speedup", "CIFAR-10"],
      "italic": ["a priori"]
    }
  },
  "formatting_summary": {
    "total_bold_contrast": 4,
    "total_bold": 7,
    "total_italic": 3,
    "sections_processed": 3,
    "formatting_strategy": "Semantic-based highlighting with method names prioritized for contrast color"
  }
}
```

**Quality Guidelines:**
- **Precision Over Quantity**: Better to under-highlight than create visual clutter
- **Semantic Consistency**: Same term type should use same formatting across sections
- **Technical Recognition**: Each keyword should be immediately recognizable to domain experts
- **Visual Balance**: Distribute highlighting styles evenly across the poster for visual harmony

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Bullet Point Independence**: This keyword highlighting is separate from bullet point formatting (â€¢ **Key Point:**)
- **Exact Matching**: Keywords must appear in text exactly as specified for proper highlighting
- **Style Hierarchy**: Bold+contrast > Bold > Italic in terms of visual prominence
- **Readability Focus**: Ensure highlighted terms enhance rather than overwhelm content comprehension

**Final Verification:**
Before finalizing selections, ensure:
1. Bold+contrast keywords represent truly unique contributions
2. Bold keywords include key quantitative results and established technical terms
3. Italic keywords are appropriate for definitional or emphatic use
4. No keyword appears in multiple formatting categories
5. Total highlighting per section stays within specified limits
