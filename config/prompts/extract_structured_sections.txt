Extract structured sections from academic paper text for poster creation.

**Paper Text:**
{{ raw_text }}

**Task:**
Extract all major sections from the paper and organize them with their content. Focus on sections that would be relevant for an academic poster.

**Section Extraction Guidelines:**

1. **Identify Major Sections:**
   - Introduction/Background
   - Related Work (if substantial)
   - Methodology/Approach
   - Experiments/Results
   - Discussion/Analysis

2. **Content Processing:**
   - Extract the main content for each section
   - Keep section content under 1000 words
   - Preserve key technical details, formulas, and findings
   - Maintain important bullet points and lists
   - Remove excessive citations and references

3. **Section Classification:**
   - **foundation**: Introduction, background, motivation, problem statement
   - **method**: Methodology, approach, algorithm, system design
   - **evaluation**: Experiments, results, analysis, validation

**Output Format:**
```json
{
  "paper_sections": [
    {
      "section_name": "Introduction",
      "section_type": "foundation",
      "content": "Main content of the section (max 1000 words)",
      "key_points": [
        "Main point 1 from this section",
        "Main point 2 from this section"
      ],
      "importance": "high|medium|low",
      "contains_figures": ["figure_1", "figure_2"],
      "contains_tables": ["table_1"]
    }
  ],
  "paper_structure": {
    "total_sections": 5,
    "foundation_sections": 2,
    "method_sections": 2,
    "evaluation_sections": 1
  }
}
```

**Critical Requirements:**
- Extract ALL major sections (don't skip any)
- Keep each section under 1000 words
- Preserve technical accuracy
- Identify which figures/tables belong to each section
- Classify section importance for poster layout

Generate structured sections that provide comprehensive paper coverage for poster creation.
