Extract a sophisticated theme color from an affiliation logo that will work well as a poster accent color.

**Core Task:**
Analyze the provided affiliation logo and identify the most prominent, meaningful color that can serve as a poster theme color. This color should be:
1. Representative of the organization's visual identity
2. Suitable for poster design applications (text highlights, accents)
3. Professional and readable when used on white backgrounds
4. Harmonious for academic poster contexts

**Color Extraction Guidelines:**

**Primary Color Identification:**
- Look for the main brand color of the organization
- Ignore pure white, black, and very light grays (background/outline colors)
- Focus on colored elements that define the logo's visual identity
- Consider text colors, graphic elements, symbols, and emblematic elements

**Color Suitability Assessment:**
- **Too Bright**: If the main color is very bright/saturated (e.g., neon yellow #FFFF00), generate a more subdued version
- **Appropriate Saturation**: Aim for colors that are vibrant but professional
- **Readability**: Ensure the color provides sufficient contrast on white backgrounds for text

**Color Adjustment Rules:**
- If original color is too bright (lightness > 85% or saturation > 90%), reduce brightness by 15-25%
- If original color is too dark (lightness < 25%), lighten slightly for better visibility
- Maintain the color's hue character while optimizing for poster applications

**Output Requirements:**
Return ONLY a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "extracted_color": "#1E3A8A",
  "color_name": "Professional Navy Blue",
  "adjustment_made": "reduced_brightness | lightened | none",
  "original_color": "#0000FF",
  "suitability_score": 8.5,
  "reasoning": "Extracted the primary blue from the university emblem. Reduced brightness from bright blue to professional navy to ensure readability and sophisticated appearance on white backgrounds.",
  "usage_notes": "Excellent for text highlights, section headers, and accent elements. Provides strong contrast while maintaining professional appearance."
}
```

**Scoring Criteria (1-10 scale):**
- **Contrast/Readability**: How well it works on white background
- **Professional Appearance**: Appropriate for academic/research contexts  
- **Brand Representation**: How well it represents the organization
- **Poster Suitability**: Effectiveness for highlights and accents

**Fallback Strategy:**
If no suitable color is found or logo is purely monochromatic, use #1E3A8A (professional navy blue) as default.

**Critical Instructions:**
- Focus on MAIN brand colors, not decorative elements
- Prioritize colors that appear in text or central graphic elements
- Ensure final color has minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio with white background
- Adjust overly bright or saturated colors to be poster-appropriate
- Provide clear reasoning for color selection and any adjustments made
